# Scribbler

The best note-taking web app you would ever need. Play a video in the web app, start scribbling some notes and timestamps of the video will be automatically saved with what you've written. You can then save the note and even share them with your friends. Works well on both desktop and mobile.

**3. In the Create Note page, let's give our note a title. Next, enter the URL of the video we are following and click the Fetch Video button.**

**5. Play the video and start typing scribbling some notes (we call this a Scribble for simplicity's sake). A timestamp icon will above the typing bar indicating the timestamp of this note you're scribbling down.**

**6. Keep adding more scribbles to your heart's content. They will appear in the content area marked with the appropriate timestamp. The timestamps are coloured with a rainbow gradient, where the earliest timestamps in relation to the video's duration are coloured red. By contrast, the latest timestamps are coloured purple. You may click on the timestamp to play the video at that particular time. When done, click on the save button on the top right hand corner.**
